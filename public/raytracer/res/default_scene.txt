# Lights are defined by position (x y z) and color
# (r g b). Two variants exist: DirLights have
# direction (x y z), but no position; SpotLights
# have position, direction, and angle (degrees)

# Try out each light variant by editing below!

# Materials hold color, phong parameters, and
# optical parameters. Color is set as (r g b).
# Phong parameters include ambient, diffuse, and
# specular constants, as well as shininess
# exponent. Optical parameters are opacity and
# index of refraction. Newly created primitives
# have the current material automatically applied
# to them. Materials can be saved and retrieved by
# name for later use.
