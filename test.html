					<td>#1</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">What conditions drove Europeans to explore west across the Atlantic?</span>
						<span id="a">Early explorers like Christopher Columbus were searching for a sea route to the east Indies, which was a major source of trade for European
							empires. <br><br> New technologies such as the mariner's compass and the astrolabe as well as the invention of the caravel made it possible for wealthy nations
							such as Spain to fund voyages west.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#2</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q"><b>Conquistadores</b></span>
						<span id="a">Spanish soldiers who conquered almost all of the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. <br><br> They killed and displaced native populations
							while spreading Spanish language and religion across America, providing the foundation for Latin American colonies and nations that would later arise there.
							<br><br> The gold they received from Native Americans brought great wealth to Europe and encouraged continued exploitation of indigenous populations.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#3</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q"><b>Encomienda</b></span>
						<span id="a">Spanish policy that allowed Caribbean colonists to "adopt" Native Americans to use them for labour and convert them to Christianity. <br><br> First
							indications of the slave trade that would become essential to Caribbean plantations</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#4</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q"><b>Treaty of Tortesillas</b></span>
						<span id="a">Divided American lands between Portugal and Spain, with Portugal receiving a small portion of coastal land that would later become Brazil.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#5</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">How did the Columbian exchange change American and European life?</span>
						<span id="a">The conquistadores' plundering of American gold and luxury goods brought huge wealth to Spain and helped to develop capitalism in Europe. <br><br>
							Horses and livestock brought to America by Europeans revolutionized Native American way of life, particularly on the Great Plains, where horses were used
							to great effect. <br><br> New crops such as corn, potatoes, beans, and tomatoes allowed Europeans to sustain large urban growth well into the 18th century.
							<br><br> Diseases like smallpox and scarlet fever decimated Native American populations, allowing colonists to easily displace them.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#6</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">How did England become involved in the New World?</span>
						<span id="a">England's protestant revolution kept it out of colonial affairs during Spain's conquest, but in the late 1500's, it emerged as wealthy, unified power
							like Spain had been at the start of the previous century. <br><br> The defeat of the Spanish armada by English sea-dogs in 1588 left the Atlantic seaway open for
							British ships. <br><br> English primogeniture, which allowed only the oldest sons of landowners to inherit land, and the enclosure of poor farmers by larger
							operations created a source of poor servants and debtors who were eager for a new life. <br><br> New wealth seeping from Spain and the emergence of the Joint-stock
							company provided funds for risky colonial undertakings in America.</span>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>#7</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">What saved Jamestown from destruction during its early years?</span>
						<span id="a">John Smith's leadership forced colonists to gather resources and plant crops rather than search for gold. <br><br> Tobacco cultivation made Jamestown
							extremely profitable, especially after the introduction of slavery by the Dutch.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#8</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q"><b>House of Burgesses</b></span>
						<span id="a">Jamestown governing body that used a parliamentary system of independent representation.<br><br> First inkling of democratic government to emerge in
							America.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#9</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q"><b>Act of Toleration</b></span>
						<span id="a">Passed by Maryland representative assembly to guarantee freedom of worship to all Christians. <br><br> Allowed Maryland to become a safe haven for
							Catholics from the surrounding protestant colonies. <br><br> First indication of Freedom of religion in America.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#10</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">What factors led to the founding of New England colonies?</span>
						<span id="a">The protestant revolution in England left a hastily converted Church of England in power that many viewed as corrupt, so some chose to become
							separatists and establish a new protestant society in America <br><br> Notable separatists included the Pilgrims who settled at Plymouth and the Puritans who
							settled the Massachusetts Bay Colony. <br><br> All northern colonies emerged as offshoots of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, including Rhode Island, which
							originated as a haven for political dissenters like Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams who questioned Congregationalism and the role of government in religious
							matters.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#11</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q"><b>John Winthrop</b></span>
						<span id="a">Leader of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. <br><br> Delivered the "city upon a hill" speech that proclaimed the idea of America as a model of prosperity
							for the rest of the world.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#12</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">What were early colonial relations with Native Americans like?</span>
						<span id="a">After being forced by hunger to raid Native American camps for food, Jamestown settlers under command of Lord De La Warr used "Irish tactics" to remove
							Native Americans from the Chesapeake during the first Anglo-Powhatan war. <br><br> After attacks on several northern Carolina settlements, Carolinians crushed
							Native Americans in the Tuscarora War. <br><br> New Englanders virtually annihilated the Pequot tribe in the Pequot war after tensions burst due to colonial
							expansion.</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>#13</td>
					
					<td class="question">
						<span id="q">What led to the rise of slavery in colonial America?</span>
						<span id="a">Indentured servants originally made up a significant portion of colonists in the Chesapeake region, but they were difficult to control, as proved by
							Bacon's rebellion against Virginia landowners.  <br><br> African slaves, first brought to America by Dutch merchants, were well suited to tobacco and rice
							cultivation in the swampy Chesapeake region due to their natural resistance to malaria <br><br> Slaves proved easier to control than indentured servants as
							"slave codes" allowed for extreme punishments for minor infractions. <br><br> Slave rebellions only occasionally flared up, notably the New York slave revolt
							of 1712 and the Stono River rebellion</span>
